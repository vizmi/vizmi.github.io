## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm vizmi, software developer by day, RPG story writer by night.

I believe writing code and crafting stories are two sides of the same creative coin. When developing, I write for other developers â€” creating narratives through clean code and thoughtful documentation that guide them through the adventure of my codebase. I'm a passionate RPG game master, designing worlds and creating adventures where players become the protagonists.

My repositories showcase this dual storytelling approach: code that speaks clearly to its readers, and RPG campaigns that invite players into immersive experiences. Both require understanding your audience, careful pacing, and attention to detail. I'm currently working toward my next big quest: writing a full-length campaign, applying the same structured creativity that makes both good code and compelling adventures."

## My repositories

### Discord bots
These bots use the javascript discord API to implement the rolling rules of the corresponding RPG. Shadowrun was a little more complex due the the different edge reroll options, but at the same time it was a lot more fun to do!
* [Shadowrun 4 Anniversary Edition](https://github.com/vizmi/sr4a-discord-bot)
* [Earthdawn 4 Edition](https://github.com/vizmi/earthdawn-discord-bot)

### Character generators
Well, I only have one right now, but I love to try new technologies on these non trivial design/coding problems. My latest creation is a showcase for sveltekit, cursor and google auth: [Shadowrun 4 character generator](https://github.com/vizmi/sr4a-chargen)

### Other side quests
* [parking-mgr](https://github.com/vizmi/parking-mgr) was created to see if redis can act as an atomicity manager in a non trivial architecture.
